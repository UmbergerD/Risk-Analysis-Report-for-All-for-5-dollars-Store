# Risk-Analysis-Report-for-All-for-5-dollars-Store
# Executive Summary:

Upon request from company owner concerning the hacking of card reader machines similar to ATMs, I conducted a full risk analysis on the point-of-sale card readers for a 50-year-old business called All for $5 Stores LTD.

I brainstormed and asked questions concerning these inputs: What do I know at this point? What are the assets, threat communities, and loss events? What are the anticipated threat paths? How frequently would the threats occur? How vulnerable is the company to these threats? And What data do I have currently and is it objective for our purposes?
These questions pointed us in the right direction to conduct the risk analysis.

My approach was to use the risk analysis using the FAIR Basic Risk Assessment Methodology. This was broken down into two stages. 
Stage 1: Scoping the analysis, which included identifying the asset at risk, threat communities under investigation, and defining the loss event. 
stage 2: Encompassing evaluate Loss Event Frequency, Estimate Contact Frequency, Estimate Probability of Action, Estimate Threat Event Frequency, Estimate Threat Capability, Estimate Resistance Strength, Vulnerability and Loss Event Frequency.

The assessment results showed the estimated minimum and maximum total loss amounts over a year, which ranged from $60,000 to $19.6 million. This is what the company could experience based on the current risk exposure. 

A Loss Exceedance Curve visually shows that the more the loss exposure is or how much All for $5 Stores is vulnerable, the greater the possibility of loss is. 

The company currently has 97.08% vulnerability based on the data given. 

# Business Problem:
The company keeps costs down by allowing a contractor to maintain the store equipment but I saw, this also opens up the door for non-invested intentions. Notably, the video surveillance is not robust with the records only keeping for one month time and reused every 30 days and could miss a device retrieval. However, the company prides itself on being well trained in loss prevention and working with local police on these matters.

Upon request from the company owner concerning the hacking of store machines similar to ATMs, I have conducted a full risk analysis on the point-of-sale card readers since it appeared after looking at loss prevention, most of the occurrences happened by shoplifting and bad checks. These can be a steady drain of cash flow and consistently hurt the company revenues. The owner is concerned about the negative publicity that data breaches can have and since All for $5 Stores is heavily involved with the local chamber of commerce and community, they want to keep the company reputation strong. I looked specifically at ATM skimmers, which sit on top of the card readers undetected and absorb data for some time, only to be retrieved later and used or sold for exploitation. I pulled together data provided by All for $5 Stores and ran a FAIR risk analysis to provide an estimate of how often and how much the company may be exposed to this form of loss.

# Methodology:
Stage 1: Scoping the analysis
  
    o Identify the asset at risk
    
    o Identify the threat communities under investigation
    
    o Define the loss event

Stage 2: Evaluate Loss Event Frequency (LEF)
  
    o Estimate Contact Frequency (CF)
    
    o Estimate Probability of Action (PoA)
    
    o Estimate Threat Event Frequency (TEF)
    
    o Estimate Threat Capability (TCap)
    
    o Estimate Resistance Strength (RS)
    
    o From the above measures, we can find Vulnerability (Vuln) and Loss Event Frequency (LEF)

# Results and Recommendations:

The Annualized Loss Exposure shows the estimated minimum and maximum total loss amounts over a year that All for $5 Stores could experience based on the current risk exposure.
The Loss Exceedance Curve visually shows that the more the loss exposure is or how much All for $5 Stores is vulnerable, the greater the possibility of loss is. As we can see as told by the numbers below, at 97.08% vulnerability. The assessment results showed the estimated minimum and maximum total loss amounts over a year, which ranged from $60,000 to $19.6 million. This is what the company could experience based on the current risk exposure.

This section below shows a Primary and Secondary loss breakdown of estimated loss frequency and per-event magnitude. This shows us by the number of threat attacks per year, the amount of loss we could be facing. For Primary loss, if we had 2 threat attacks that year, we could be facing around $5900 in losses. For Secondary loss, if we had 10 threat attacks that year, we could be facing around $2.4M in losses.

The noteable recommendations were:
1. Physically check for card skimmers â€“ this may be the best way to discourage dishonest employees or vendors to use them by actually checking for them on top of the card readers. Given that they need to sit for some time to collect data, there is more of a likelihood that they would sit versus not sit there.

2. Stress the training point to employees to look for these skimmers and perhaps even offer incentives on apprehending one of them. It would be wise to have additional loss prevention training relating to what to look for in finding them.

3. Upgrade the video surveillance equipment since the card skimmer can self-power for 45 days, this is longer than the period of videotapes

# Next Steps:
1. Have local police presence in the stores near the point-of-sale registers to discourage any activity. Even one officer would be sufficient.

2. Publicly project that they are on the lookout and addressing the issue. This would let their customer base that they are taking this seriously and ensure that no one is taken by surprise. This would also help reputation.

3. Investigate card readers that would reject skimmers physically or the software would not work with one.
